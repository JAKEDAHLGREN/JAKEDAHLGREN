Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Greetings! I'm Jake Dahlgren, a dedicated Software Engineer with a passion for delivering user-centric products and solutions. My journey through the world of technology has been marked by an unwavering commitment to problem-solving and continuous personal and professional development.

Key Skills and Achievements

My skill set encompasses a broad range of technologies and methodologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Ruby on Rails, TailwindCSS, Git, and more. I continue to prove my abilities when collaborate within a fast-paced teams, to ensure our projects are not just delivered, but are delivered with quality, efficiency, and innovation.

Project Highlights

One project that showcases my capabilities is ConcertGo (github.com/Wham-Devs/concert-go-frontend). As the lead on a team of four, we developed a full-stack application within a tight two-week deadline. Not only did we achieve an impressive 90% test coverage using RSpec and React Testing Library, but we also implemented user authentication with Devise-JWT and integrated the Ticketmaster API for event searches. This project exemplifies my ability to meet and exceed expectations even under demanding circumstances.

Professional Experience

As a Software Developer for the start-up ZOEE, I restructured email and phone verification workflows to improve the user onboarding experiences. I also utilized TailwindCSS for consistent styling across various devices and screens. My role extended to creating marketing and communication email templates and translating Figma wireframes into polished components using TypeScript and React. This demonstrates my commitment to creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces.

During my time as a Software Developer Intern at ZOEE, I increased user accessibility, demonstrated problem-solving skills, and gained hands-on experience with modern frontend technologies. My experiences at ZOEE have allowed me to grow as a developer, continuously improving my skills and knowledge.

Fun Facts

I am transitioning into tech from the medical field where, for the last 7 years, I built custom Orthotics and Prosthetics. I fell in love with disecting the user/patients needs and translating them into technical specs, so that we could build fully custom devices with optimized outcomes for our patients.
